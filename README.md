# â€¢	Object Detection and Tracking Using YOLO & SORT Algorithms:
Implemented object detection and tracking using AI-based SORT &amp; YOLO algorithms to detect and track video frames of objects and human beings. Implemented Non-Max Suppression (NMS) and Kalman Filtering for maximizing accuracy and minimizing false detection. Adjusted the detection parameters to increase object identification and tracking accuracy.
